        <p>Q: Are Territory tiles discarded back to the pool?<br>
            A: <a href="/thread/2276956/article/32949098#32949098">Just to a discard pile. If you run out of
                the main pool of tiles, you can shuffle the discards back in.</a></p>

        <p>Q: Can benefits be taken in any order?<br>
            A: <a href="/thread/2277604/article/32963462#32963462">Yes, unless otherwise specified.</a></p>

        <p>Q: What is the timing of gaining Landmarks (before or after benefits/bonuses)?<br>
            A: <a href="/thread/2278028/article/32963481#32963481">First! Before benefits/bonuses</a></p>

        <p>Q: After Dictatorship tech card is played, are mandatory advancements no longer mandatory, or do
            they override the Dicatorship's lock? Examples are the Renaissance, Socialism, Age of Discovery,
            and Dark Ages tech cards. <br>
            A: Dictatorship prevents all movement on a track until that player's next turn. If it's played
            first, it prevents token movements from other cards.<br>
            Socialism: You could not choose the blocked track.<br>
            Renaissance: Advance on all tracks except the blocked track.<br>
            Age of Discovery: If the blocked track is rolled, only the person who played the Dictatorship
            tapestry advances (they're the only one not blocked on that track).<br>
            Dark Ages: You must choose to regress on the blocked track and two others (you're blocked from
            advancing, not regressing). Take the advancement on the remaining track.</p>

        <p>Q: When aligning terrain for points during exploration, what's considered an aesthetic river, and
            what isn't?<br>
            A: The thin water spaces between territories are considered aesthetic. They are there so tiles
            look nice when lining up against water spaces. However, anything thicker represents water, which
            is not aligned. <a href="/thread/2461876/article/35296311#35296311">Re: Tile terrain question
                (does this tile score?)</a></p>

        <p><strong>Text:</strong> The Alchemists love to push their luck in the hopes of
            accelerated
            advancement. <strong>At the beginning of your income turns (2-5),</strong> roll the
            science die
            and mark the result here with a player token. You may then roll again or stop.</p>

        <p>If you roll an advancement you've already rolled, you bust. Remove all tokens and
            gain [RESOURCE]
            as consolation for your terrible luck. Otherwise, when you stop, you may advance on
            each of the
            advancement tracks you rolled (don't gain benefits or bonuses). Then remove all
            tokens.</p>

        <p>Each time the final results of this ability would push you off the end of a track,
            gain
